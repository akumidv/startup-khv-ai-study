    "\n",
    "This script shows an implementation of Actor Critic method on CartPole-V0 environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actor Critic Method\n",
    "\n",
    "As an agent takes actions and moves through an environment, it learns to map\n",
    "the observed state of the environment to two possible outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recommended action: A probability value for each action in the action space.\n",
    "   The part of the agent responsible for this output is called the **actor**.\n",
    "2. Estimated rewards in the future: Sum of all rewards it expects to receive in the\n",
    "   future. The part of the agent responsible for this output is the **critic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent and Critic learn to perform their tasks, such that the recommended actions\n",
    "from the actor maximize the rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CartPole-V0\n",
    "\n",
    "A pole is attached to a cart placed on a frictionless track. The agent has to apply\n",
    "force to move the cart. It is rewarded for every time step the pole\n",
    "remains upright. The agent, therefore, must learn to keep the pole from falling over.\n",
